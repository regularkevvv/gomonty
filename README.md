# gomonty

`gomonty` is an experimental fork of
[ewhauser/gomonty](https://github.com/ewhauser/gomonty) providing Go bindings to
[Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty). The Go package keeps the compatible
package name `monty`, while the Rust boundary is mapped to Monty's current
subprocess architecture through pinned Cargo git dependencies.

Documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/regularkevvv/gomonty

## Status

- Experimental.
- Go module path: `github.com/regularkevvv/gomonty`
- Upstream runtime: Monty `v0.0.19` (`e347739909877f4fb03877e23dd092286fc7e659`)
- Go bindings are cgo-free and use `purego` with a bundled shared library and
  version-matched worker executable
- Rust FFI crate: `crates/monty-go-ffi`
- Protocol worker crate: `crates/gomonty-worker`
- Upstream Monty source: pinned in the root [`Cargo.toml`](./Cargo.toml)
- Native shared libraries and worker executables: checked into
  `internal/ffi/lib/<target>`
- Generated header: checked into `internal/ffi/include/monty_go_ffi.h`
- Alpine/musl builds use a separate `musl` Go build tag and musl-specific shared libraries

Tagged source trees must already contain both native artifacts required by the
runtime loader. GitHub release assets are optional convenience copies, not the
source of truth for Go module consumers.

Monty code executes in a child process managed by Monty's worker pool. This
provides crash isolation, process replacement, parent-side timeout enforcement,
and serializable session recovery. It is not an OS security sandbox: filesystem,
network, and other confinement still require a separate policy and sandboxing
layer.

## Repository Layout

- `*.go`, `vfs/`, `internal/ffi/`: copied Go bindings adapted to the root module layout
- [`go/README.md`](./go/README.md): consumer-facing Go API notes and examples carried over from the source repo
- `examples/`: standalone example module for local consumption examples
- `crates/monty-go-ffi/`: Rust C ABI adapter over `monty-pool`
- `crates/gomonty-worker/`: small version-matched Monty protocol child
- `scripts/build-go-ffi.sh <target-triple>`: builds one target's shared library
  and worker into `internal/ffi/lib/...`

## Build Notes

The Go package is cgo-free. It uses `purego` to load a bundled shared library
for the current target and starts the adjacent bundled `gomonty-worker`
executable. The worker speaks the exact Monty v0.0.19 protocol expected by the
FFI library; initialization fails fast if it cannot be spawned or negotiated.

On first use, the loader extracts both artifacts to a content-addressed directory
under `os.UserCacheDir()` with an `os.TempDir()` fallback, marks the worker
executable on Unix, then initializes a process-wide elastic worker pool.

Default Linux builds target the GNU/glibc shared libraries. Alpine and other musl-based Linux builds must opt into the musl family with the `musl` Go build tag.

The `verify` workflow runs `CGO_ENABLED=0` Go tests on native Linux, macOS, and Windows runners. Musl shared libraries are build-verified rather than executed in CI.

To build or refresh both native artifacts for the current host:

```bash
scripts/build-go-ffi.sh aarch64-apple-darwin
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test ./...
```

Requirements:

- Go 1.25+
- Rust toolchain
- Python available on `PATH`, or `PYO3_PYTHON` set explicitly
- `cbindgen` only when regenerating `internal/ffi/include/monty_go_ffi.h`

For repeat builds where the checked-in header does not need to change, set `MONTY_GO_FFI_SKIP_HEADER=1`.

For Alpine or another musl-based Linux environment:

```bash
scripts/build-go-ffi.sh x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
go test -tags musl ./...
```

## Consumer Example

For normal consumers, the intended path is to depend on a tagged version of this
repo whose source tree already contains the native shared library and worker for
the consumer's target platform.

Add the module:

```bash
go get github.com/regularkevvv/gomonty@latest
```

Or in `go.mod`:

```go
require github.com/regularkevvv/gomonty vX.Y.Z
```

Then import and use it:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	monty "github.com/regularkevvv/gomonty"
)

func main() {
	runner, err := monty.New("40 + 2", monty.CompileOptions{
		ScriptName: "example.py",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	value, err := runner.Run(context.Background(), monty.RunOptions{})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(value.Raw())
}
```

The same example lives in [`examples/cmd/example`](./examples/cmd/example). To run it from this repo checkout:

```bash
cd examples
CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./cmd/example
```

If you are consuming a branch, local checkout, or unreleased commit instead of a
prepared tag, you may need to build or refresh both native artifacts for your platform
first:

```bash
scripts/build-go-ffi.sh aarch64-apple-darwin
```

For Alpine or musl-based Linux consumers, also add the `musl` build tag when
building or testing your application:

```bash
go build -tags musl ./...
```

## Benchmarks

The Go benchmark suite mirrors the current upstream Monty benchmark cases so
the two projects exercise the same scripts and expected outputs. The shared
kitchen-sink workload is copied into [`testdata/bench_kitchen_sink.py`](./testdata/bench_kitchen_sink.py).

With a host shared library built, run the local Go-only benchmarks with:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkMonty -benchmem
```

This covers the parse-once/repeated-run benchmark cases plus
`BenchmarkMontyEndToEnd` for parse-and-run in the loop.

There are also Go-specific benchmark suites for wrapper overhead:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkMontyCallbacks -benchmem
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkMontyDecompose -benchmem
```

These add:

- callback-heavy runs with repeated external function and OS handler calls
- low-level decomposition benchmarks for compile-only, dump/load, start-to-first-progress, name lookup, call resume, and pending resume paths

To capture CPU and allocation profiles for the representative hot paths, run:

```bash
scripts/profile-benchmarks.sh
```

By default the script writes profiles and `pprof -top` summaries to `/tmp/gomonty-bench-profiles` for:

- `BenchmarkMontyEndToEnd`
- `BenchmarkMonty/list_append_int`
- `BenchmarkMontyCallbacks/external_loop`

To compare `gomonty` against a local upstream Monty checkout on the same host,
run:

```bash
python3 scripts/compare-benchmarks.py --upstream ../monty
```

The comparison script:

- runs the Go benchmark suite and aggregates the median `ns/op` across three runs
- runs the upstream Criterion `__monty` benchmarks
- sets `PYO3_PYTHON` for the upstream run if the upstream checkout still expects a local `.venv/bin/python3`
- prints a Markdown table suitable for pasting back into this README

The previous sample table measured the retired in-process v0.0.9 binding and is
intentionally not retained: subprocess startup, checkout reuse, and protocol
round trips make those numbers inapplicable to the v0.0.19 architecture. Run
the comparison script on the target host before publishing new results.

## Fuzzing

The repo also includes Go fuzz targets for:

- `FuzzValueJSON`: pure-Go value wire-format decoding and normalization
- `FuzzCompileAndRun`: arbitrary source strings compiled and executed with tight resource limits
- `FuzzLoadRunner`: arbitrary bytes fed through `LoadRunner`, including valid dumped-runner seeds

Run a short fuzzing pass with:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -run '^$' -fuzz FuzzValueJSON -fuzztime=10s .
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -run '^$' -fuzz FuzzCompileAndRun -fuzztime=10s .
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -run '^$' -fuzz FuzzLoadRunner -fuzztime=10s .
```

The native runner fuzzers require a supported host shared library and run with
`CGO_ENABLED=0`. `FuzzValueJSON` remains pure Go.

## Upstream Overrides

The default build uses pinned git dependencies on `https://github.com/pydantic/monty.git`. For local development against a sibling checkout, you can temporarily override them with a Cargo patch:

```toml
[patch."https://github.com/pydantic/monty.git"]
monty = { path = "../monty/crates/monty" }
monty-pool = { path = "../monty/crates/monty-pool" }
monty-proto = { path = "../monty/crates/monty-proto" }
monty-types = { path = "../monty/crates/monty-types" }
monty-type-checking = { path = "../monty/crates/monty-type-checking" }
```

See [`RELEASING.md`](./RELEASING.md) for bumping the upstream pin and for the protected-branch release flow: `make release` opens the release-prep PR, then `make publish-release VERSION=vX.Y.Z` tags merged `main`, creates the GitHub release, and warms the Go module proxy.
